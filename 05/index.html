      <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> This week, I could finally go back to my initial design idea of a rotating square vase and print it out. I started with the general design from week 2. Like I said in my week 2 writeup, trying to design a piece like this using laser cut parts would not work without hand-cutting grooves into the z-axis of the walls. Using a full 3D model and printing it out, I could rotate the walls without having to worry about the whole structure disassembling by layer because the plastic would be bonded together in the location I wanted.  </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> Similar to my first week 2 sketch, I started by sketching the square base on fusion 360. I set the wall thickness, layer height, and side rotation angle to parameters in my project, allowing the entire thing to be scaled as needed with ease. In my planar sketch, I created a center point in the square, and an inner square to mark the end of the wall area. From there, I extruded the inner base as one body before extruding the first wall layer as its own body. With this first body extruded, building the next wall segment simply was a matter of copying.</p>

      <div class="col-md-9">
         <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> I pressed 'm' in fusion, moved the center of rotation to the centerpoint of my planar sketch, raised the segment by the height of my wall segment parameter, and rotated the wall by my angle parameter. I wanted to complete at least one 90 degree rotation around the center point with my walls to get the full rotation effect, so I continued to copy my walls in larger and larger segments as the wall grew. For example, after this two-part wall was completed, I copied both walls as one entity, rotating and raising both pieces by double the parametrized amounts. With a wall of four segments, i did the same, creating an eight segment wall, etc. Using this method, I built 18 layers of wall (copying the last two segments from the top two segments of my previous copy).  </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> This process wasn't too terrible. I started with the button code framework from the example, adding the code to create the song of my choice from github. I put the song playing function within the part of the code that was only activated upon button press, meaning my song would only play when I pressed the button. This strategy ended up working first try! I was quite excited--that was until I heard the song. </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> It turns out our composer has serious problems with the letter B, as all B flats and B notes were replaced with A sharps and As in the buzzer composition. Also, there were a bunch of random note errors, where the buzzer played a bunch of natural notes where they should have been sharps. So, I stepped through the composition with my piano app and fixed the wrong notes. I then realized that some of the rhythms were also off, so I added a few eigth rests here and there to fill out the composition and make it sound more familiar. Can you figure out the tune from the code sheet music? </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.9vw; width: 95%; text-align: left; padding-left: 5%;"> With the tune fixed, I could finally run my doorbell. Despite not having a casing to package it in, I still think the final product is really fun! This could be a cool way to reinvent my music box from last week with some of my own tunes.</p>
